/**
 * One-time sign-in through the central platform IdP, persisted as Playwright
 * storage state so every spec reuses the session instead of logging in per
 * test. This is the standard Playwright auth pattern and it matters here for
 * two reasons:
 *
 *  - The IdP's {@code AuthRateLimitFilter} throttles {@code /login} at
 *    20 requests/min/IP, and all docker traffic collapses to one source IP —
 *    a per-test login (14+ specs) trips it. Reusing the session means only
 *    THIS setup hits {@code /login}; every spec silently re-auths via the IdP
 *    session cookie through {@code /oauth2/authorize}, which is not throttled.
 *  - The credential is entered exactly once.
 *
 * Prereq: the platform stack (IdP on :8090, with the DEMO module + demo-module
 * client registered) and the demo stack (frontend :8082) must be running.
